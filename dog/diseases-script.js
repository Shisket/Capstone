        blurb: "Rabies is a virus that is carried in the saliva of infected animals. Once an animal is bitten, it takes anywhere from three to twelve weeks for the virus to make its way through the nervous system into the brain and spinal cord. This is called the incubation period. Rabies can be prevented by a series of vaccines or can be treated during the incubation period by a series of shots. Once symptoms appear, the infected animal will likely die within a week. Symptoms include weakness, excessive drool, confusion, fear of water, aggression, and paralysis. Only mammals can get rabies.",

        blurb: "Parvovirus is a virus that is carried in the feces of infected animals. There are two types, one that attacks the gastrointestinal system and one that attacks the cardiovascular system. In the gastrointestinal type, the infected animal stops being able to digest food, so it doesnâ€™t get energy or nutrients from the food. In the cardiovascular type, the infection hurts the heart, making it too weak to do its job well. The incubation period is three to seven days, and after symptoms appear, they can kill the animal within three days. Symptoms include high fever, lethargy, weakness, loss of appetite, vomiting, and dehydration. Parvovirus can be prevented by a series of vaccines.",

        blurb: "Kennel cough is similar to a common cold in humans. It is a term used for a group of different viruses and bacteria that cause similar symptoms. The most common pathogens include Bordetella Bronchiseptica and Canine Parainfluenza. The incubation period is three to ten days. The most obvious symptom of kennel cough is a cough that sounds like a honk. Other symptoms include gagging and having a fever.  Kennel cough is often spread in places where many dogs are in close contact, such as a kennel, shelter, or dog park.",
