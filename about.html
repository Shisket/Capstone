      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h3>Hi! My name is Shira, and I am a high school senior in California. In school, I tend to focus on STEM and art. In my freetime, I figure skate. I plan to be a veterinarian when I grow up. This has been my dream for a while, but as a child, I found that there weren't many options for me to learn about veterinary medicine. I am hoping to change that.</h3>

      <h3>At my school, seniors take a class called Capstone, in which we apply our knowledge and skills to an independent project on a real world issue that is personally significant and that promotes engagement with our local community.</h3>

    <h1>About My Project</h1>
    <h3>For my project, I decided to address a few issues that I have noticed in my community. First, there is a shortage of veterinary staff. This is true across the country. This shortage means that it may be harder to get an appointment with your veterinarian, emergency animal care may be delayed, and the staff that practices do have may be overworked. The second issue I noticed was that when I was younger, there weren't many opportunities for me to learn about veterinary medicine. I went to Humane Society Camp for one week every summer, but beyond that I struggled to find places I could explore this subject. There aren't enough ways for kids to learn about veterinary medicine.<br><br>My Capstone project is to solve both these problems by creating a website to interest, involve, and educate kids and teenagers about veterinary medicine. Welcome to my project.</h3>
